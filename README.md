Nhea Framework
====

Nhea Framework is a set of tools that helped me over years. This is a small part of my framework. 

This branch consists of repository pattern and entity framework implemented repository base classes.

You need to create a repository library which hase a base repository class deriving from entity framework base repository.

This new repository library must implement a repository class for each entity.
